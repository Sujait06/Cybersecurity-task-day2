##  Phishing Indicators Identified

1. **Too-Good-To-Be-True Offer**  
   - The email promises a chance to win a **$200 Amazon gift card** just for a 5-minute survey. This is a classic phishing tactic to lure the victim.

2. **Suspicious Tracking URLs**  
   - Links include very long UTM tracking parameters that mask their true destination. Example:
     ```
     https://tally.so/r/w2YZag?email=99220041055@klu.ac.in&utm_campaign=...
     ```

3. **Generic Survey Link & Urgency**  
   - Claims that the offer **expires soon** to pressure immediate action (social engineering).

4. **Spoofed Marketing Style**  
   - The sender appears to be legitimate, but domain `cioeu99889.novoresume.net` is **not the official Novorésumé website** — could be a spoofed subdomain.

5. **Header Analysis**  
   - `Return-Path`: postmaster@cioeu99889.novoresume.net  
   - **SPF**: Pass  
   - **DKIM**: Pass  
   - **DMARC**: Pass  
   > Although SPF/DKIM/DMARC passed, phishing emails can still pass these checks if sent from compromised or authorized third-party services.

6. **Marketing Disguised as Phishing**  
   - The email mimics legitimate newsletters but manipulates emotional triggers: winning money, fear of missing out, and personalization using recipient's name.

##  Conclusion

- Overpromising incentives
- Generic marketing tone
- Potentially spoofed sender domains

 This kind of email should be flagged and reported if unsolicited.
